          Frozen is a 2013 American 3D computer-animated adventure musical
          fantasy comedy-drama film, created and produced at Walt Disney
          Animation Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion
          Pictures. Inspired by the Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale, The Snow
          Queen, it is the 53rd animated feature in the Disney Animated Canon.

          The story centers fearless optimist but also naive Princess Anna, who
          embarks on a perilous journey to save her kingdom from a curse
          conjured by her older sister, Queen Elsa. Along the way, she partners
          up with a misanthropic mountain man, his trusty reindeer, and an
          enchanted snowman with dreams of experiencing summer. All the while,
          Anna's supposedly "dashing" fianc√©, Prince Hans, has his own plans for
          the queen and her kingdom.

          The film premiered at the El Capitan Theatre on November 19, 2013 and
          went into general theatrical release on November 27 in the United
          States, Canada, and the Philippines. It was met with widespread
          acclaim from critics and audiences, winning two Academy Awards for
          Best Animated Feature and Best Original Song ("Let It Go"), among
          numerous other accolades. Frozen was also a commercial success; it
          accumulated over $1.2 billion in worldwide box office revenue, $400
          million of which were earned in the United States and Canada and $247
          million of which were earned in Japan. It was the fifth
          highest-grossing film of all time (behind Avatar, Titanic, The
          Avengers and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2) and the
          highest-grossing animated film of all time until it was surpassed by
          its sequel Frozen II in 2019. It is currently the 16th
          highest-grossing film of all time and the second highest-grossing
          animated film of all time (behind Frozen II).

          Frozen was followed up with a 2015 theatrical short, Frozen Fever, and
          a 2017 theatrical featurette, Olaf's Frozen Adventure. A stage
          adaptation made its debut on Broadway in 2018. A feature-length
          sequel, titled Frozen II, was released on November 22, 2019.
