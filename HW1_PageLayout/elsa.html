          “In Arendelle's fair kingdom, a ruler did appear Born with a secret
          power so great, alone, she stayed in fear Although the force was
          hidden, one day she let it go And all the land was covered in eternal
          ice and snow” <br />
          ―Frozen trailer's narration
        </p>
        <p>
          Elsa the Snow Queen is the deuteragonist of Disney's 2013 animated
          feature film, Frozen, and the protagonist of its 2019 sequel. Born
          with the power of ice and snow, Elsa is the firstborn daughter of King
          Agnarr and Queen Iduna, the older sister of Queen Anna, and the former
          queen of Arendelle. Throughout most of her young life, Elsa feared
          that her powers were monstrous. Therefore, she isolated herself from
          the world as a means of protecting her family and kingdom. Elsa's
          anxieties would eventually trigger a curse that plunged Arendelle into
          an eternal winter. Through Anna's love, however, Elsa was able to
          control her powers and live peacefully amongst her people with a
          newfound self-confidence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Three years into her reign, Elsa is called forth to Ahtohallan to
          assume her rightful place as the Fifth Spirit of the Enchanted Forest,
          whose purpose is to bridge the magic of nature and people. She thereby
          abdicates the throne, allowing Anna to rise as the new queen of
          Arendelle.
